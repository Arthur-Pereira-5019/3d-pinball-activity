# 3D Pinball Games

3D Pinball-Like game developed for the "Programming for Games" discipline of my IT course, most assets and scripts were given to us by the teacher, but some things we had to did on our own for creativity points, for example I limited the distance the enemies can find you, created conditional enemy spawners, a coin that freezes the enemies for some time and telepads.
